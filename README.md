# astral-wordpress

### Overview

This is a basic starter project for an Ionic React App leveraging the WordPress REST API as a backend.

Built as a training demo as covered in the following post: [How to Build a WordPress Powered React App with Ionic](https://sknow.it/blog/how-to-build-a-wordpress-powered-react-app-with-ionic/)

For more information on how to get started please refer to the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ion.link/docs).

### Headscratchers Area (ignore me)
